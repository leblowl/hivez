# Lokate

Lokate is a little app for tracking location-based resources, originally developed for tracking bee hives for Bee Friendly Honey.

Sweet, I just got a demo up on Heroku, so you can play with it @ http://lokate-demo.herokuapp.com/. I will propably push updates at random intervals when I've made progress, expect broken/unimplemented areas.

# Build

Lokate uses the boot build tool (https://github.com/boot-clj/boot). With this installed, in the project directory, you can run ```boot dev``` to get a localhost dev server setup or run ```boot prod``` to package the app as a standalone jar. Always a work in progress, enjoy :)
